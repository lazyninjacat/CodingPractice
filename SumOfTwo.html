    <h1>Sum of Two</h1>
    <h2>
      The Problem:
    </h2>
    <p>
      You have two integer arrays, a and b, and an integer target value v.
      Determine whether there is a pair of numbers, where one number is taken
      from a and the other from b, that can be added together to get a sum of v.
      Return true if such a pair exists, otherwise return false.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,<br /><br />
      a = [1, 2, 3]<br />
      b = [10, 20, 30, 40] <br />
      v = 42<br />
      40 + 2 = 42<br />
      sumOfTwo(a, b, v) = true
    </p>
    <p>
      Use your intuition to come up with an algorithm.
    </p>
    <h3>Solution 1 -- Brute Force Method</h3>
    <p>Use as many nested for loops as necessary, big O time be damned!</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Solution 2 -- Hash Set Method</h3>
    <p>
      Much faster. Use a data structure. In this case, a hash set! Or rather,
      since this is JavaScript, a hash set object! This way we can have two
      sequancial for loops instead of a nested for loop. If the brute force
      method is AxB, this hash set data structure method is A+B. MUCH BETTER!
    </p>
    <p>The moral of the story: use data structures!</p>
